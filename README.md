Sokoban game in Python for Artificial Intelligence class.
Specs OS: Windows 10
Language: Python 3.7.7



## Setup

-  Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Khoacannotcode/sokoban.git
```
- Install requirement packets
```
pip install - r requirements.txt
```
## Implemented algorithms

In this project, I've implemented some main algorithms for solving sokoban problem as follow:

1. Depth-First-Search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
3. Uniform-Cost-Search (UCS)

>Note: Future developments will be updated

## Run the game

```
python Sokoban.py --algo algo_to_use
```
While `algo_to_use` include `dfs, bfs` and `ucs` .

## Autoplay

When the game is launched,  **autorun** will not be activated. To do that, you need to click on the `Auto` button in the upper right corner of the game interface.
